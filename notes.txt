Need to extend User (done)
Need to hide User (public: false)

No way to automatically say, "when making ob, set owner to me"
Link A to B(where B extends user) * thats the magic


the object X belongs to me if:

[12:26]  
a) it has a relation to a model that extends user (and obviously it points to me)

[12:26]  
b) it has a simple property called userId where the val matches my user ID

[12:26]  
c) ditto for "owner"


When locking down a method - how do you know the names?

beforeSave, set to currentuser

auth req error even though logged in
